## :rocket: Running the Full Application
    
- Run on an emulator:

    - Open **Android Studio** and go to **Tools > Device Manager**.

    - Create a new emulator (click the **`+`** to create a new virtual device) or select an existing device.

    - Click the **`â–¶`** (play button) to launch the emulator.

    - Once the emulator is running, execute the following command in your terminal to launch the app on the emulator:

        - **Start the backend server**:
        
            ```
            python app.py

            ```
            npm start
            ```

## :key: Logging In

To log in to the app, use the credentials for the test user created during the database seeding process. The default test user can be found in the `seed_user_data.py` file, located in the `backend-new/schema` directory.

### Default Test User Credentials

- Email: `test-user@email.com`
- Password: `Password123` (This password is hashed in the database)

You can use these credentials to log in during development. If you need to modify or update the test user data, please follow these steps:

- Open the `seed_user_data.py` file.
- The relevant code snippet for the test user data is as follows:
    ```
    # Seed the user data
    def seed_data(connection):
    try:
        # Test user data
        first_name = 'Test'
        last_name = 'User'
        email = 'test-user@email.com'
        password = 'Password123'
    ```
    In this block, you can modify the `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`, and `password` fields.

After making changes, the updated user data will be inserted into the database when the `seed_data()` function runs. Be sure to delete the `database.db` file if it already exists to start fresh and ensure a clean setup.

### Seed Data for Transactions and Budgets

The `seed_data.sql` file contains predefined transactions and budget entries designed for testing different financial scenarios, including low balance, surplus, and negative budget conditions. It also includes various income and expense categories, along with sample transactions spanning multiple months.
